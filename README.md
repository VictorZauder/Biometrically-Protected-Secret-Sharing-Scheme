# Biometrically-Protected-Secret-Sharing-Scheme
The code within the SecretSharingGen.py file is a python 3 code that demonstrate the concept of a secret sharing scheme combined with biometric identification for higher security. A random 64 bit master key is generated and used to encrypt a user inputted plaintext using DES. This master key is then encrypted and split into three shares. Each of these three shares is assigned to a specific individual and can only be accessed by their fingerprint. Once the three fingerprints are detected, the shares are recovered and the master key reconstructed. Using this reconstructed master key, the program proceeds to decrypt the ciphertext using DES.  

For the DES mode of operations, electronic code book (ECB) is used due to its simplicity, reliability, and flexibility. For efficiency, most of the operations that are executed repeatedly in the encryption and decryption processes are defined in user defined functions, such as converting hexadecimals to binary and vice-versa.

This program can be executed using any python interpreter, We used Visual Studio Code. It does, however, require the use of an external fingerprint reader connected to some type of microcontroller. This microcontroller has to be programmed first. In this case we are using an Arduino Uno, and used the Arduino IDE to code and upload the system into the microcontroller. Once that is setup, the program can be run via python directly.
